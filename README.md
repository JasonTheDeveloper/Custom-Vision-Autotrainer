# Custom-Vision-Autotrainer
An autotraining tool for customvision.ai using Azure Blob Storage and Azure Pipelines

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/aussiedevcrew/Custom-Vision-Autotrainer/_apis/build/status/Microsoft.Custom-Vision-Autotrainer?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/aussiedevcrew/Custom-Vision-Autotrainer/_build/latest?definitionId=7&branchName=master)

## Features

 * Data Catalogue
 * Train, Test, and Holdout sets
 * CLI, Python and CI/CD friendly
 * Get started quickly with local uploads
 * Store labels with images
 * Select data for training Custom Vision models
 * Train and export your models

### Data Catalogue

Backed by [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/storage/), Autotrainer helps you maintain a large collection of labelled images for machine learning.

### Train, Test, and Holdout sets

Machine learning often requires the use of multiple datasets that must remain segregated. Autotrainer provides three containers for image datasets: train, test, and holdout.

 * Train: Used to training the model.
 * Test:  Used to test the model during training, and potentially join the training set.
 * Holdout: Validate your model using this unseen data.

### CLI, Python and CI/CD Friendly

Consume autotrainer via the CLI, in Python code, or run in [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/devops/pipelines/).

### Get started quickly

Upload a set of images from a directory in a single command.

### Store labels with images

Labels are stored in special *label* files, right next to the image in blob storage.

```bash
  python src/autotrainer/autotrainer_cli.py catalogue upload -d path/to/your/dataset -l LABEL -c {train|test|holdout}
```

### Select data for a Custom Vision project

Select images from your training set, and push them to a Custom Vision project.

```bash
  python src/autotrainer/autotrainer_cli.py select -c train --project CUSTOM_VISION_PROJECT_ID
```

### Train and export your models

Automate the training and exporting of models.

# Quickstart

## Docker

```sh
docker run -it -e "CV_ENDPOINT=https://southcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com" -e "CV_TRAINING_KEY=your_key" -e "STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string" flanagan89/custom-vision-autotrainer -h
```

## Configuration

Autotrainer requires three environment variables:

 * `CV_ENDPOINT` : The location of your custom vision service, e.g. https://southcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com
 * `CV_TRAINING_KEY` : Your custom vision training key
 * `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONNECTION_STRING` : Connection string to an Azure Storage Account

# Build

## Setup environment and install dependencies

I recommend using [Mini Conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to manage your python environment. Download and install miniconda, then in a shell:

1. Create a conda environment: `conda create -n customvisionautotrainer python=3.6`
2. Activate the environment: `activate customvisionautotrainer`. 
3. Install runtime dependencies: `pip install -r src/autotrainer/requirements.txt`
4. Install developer dependencies: `pip install -r src/autotrainer/requirements-dev.txt`
5. Configure environment variables (see above) 

## Run the Autotrainer CLI

```sh
$ cd src/autotrainer
$ python ./autotrainer_cli.py -h
usage: autotrainer [cv, catalogue, select] <options>

Autotrainer tools

positional arguments:
  command     Subcommand to run

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

$ python ./autotrainer_cli.py catalogue -h
usage: autotrainer catalogue <options>

Data Catalogue tools

positional arguments:
  {describe,upload}  Catalogue options

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
```

# Test

Autotrainer uses [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

First, run Azurite for local blob storage testing:

```sh
$ cd src/
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Then you can run the tests.

```sh
$ cd src/autotrainer
$ nosetests
............
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 12 tests in 7.088s

OK
``` 

> NOTE: Some tests require access to a *real* Azure Storage account and Custom Vision service. See the environment variable section above.
